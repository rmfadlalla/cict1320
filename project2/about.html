            <p>If you don't know me, hey! My name is Wes Weston and I'm an investigative journalist.</p>
            <p>I've always wanted to show people the world outside their own bubbles, and let them see the parts of it that they'd never look twice at. That's what I plan to do on this site</p>
            <p>Call me a conspiracy theorist all you want. Say I'm crazy, it doesn't matter. I'll prove I'm right. Just you wait.</p>
            <p>I also play basketball for the Casper High Ravens.</p>
